// This is the SETUP function - all Arduino programs have ONE Setup function
// In the setup function, we declare whether or not we use each pin for an ouput or input. The difference between outputs and inputs is quite simple.
// If we set something as an input, that means were are getting data from it and using it for something else. This could be a ultrasonic or touch sensor.
// If we set something as an output, that means it will do something as a result of the data we are getting. For example this could be a motor.
// We can also use the setup function to attach motors or sensors if necessary

  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT); // This sets the ledPin to Output
  leftMotor.attach(leftMotorPin); // This attaches the VEX motor to pin 9

  pinMode(touchPin, INPUT); //This sets the touch sensor as an input. It needs to be an input because we are receiving data from it.

//This lines of code basically make the motor function.
// According to the YouTube video I watched, he explained it as the map command allows the motor to get an input value of 0-100 instead of from 
// 1000-2000 which would be the input for other servo motors. Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2LpwizZARw&t=625s&ab_channel=EvanWeinberg
